# The Car Price prediction deployment model could be accessed at: https://car-price-pred-machine-learnin.herokuapp.com/

Model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Utilized Recursive Feature Elimination to initially reduce the number of input variables. Based on VIF and P-values of the input variables further reduced the number of input variables for final model.
